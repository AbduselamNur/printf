This repo is created to do our own "printf" of the original function Of C
What is printf?
Printf format string refers to a control parameter used by a class of functions in the input/output libraries of C and many other programming languages. The string is written in a simple template language: characters are usually copied literally into the function's output, but format specifiers, which start with a % character, indicate the location and method to translate a piece of data (such as a number) to characters.

FORMAT SPECIFIERS
The format specifiers set the display output format of the arguments. This our Format Specifiesrs our function _printf:

s - Print a single-byte or multi-byte character string;
c - Print a single-byte character
d - Print Signed decimal integer.
i - Print Signed decimal integer.
% - Print a symbol "%"

	0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
mandatory
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c
s
%
You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
